# Rube Goldberg Animation

### Animation Boiler Plate Getting Started

1. [Fork](https://github.com/omahacodeschool/project-boilerplate#fork-destination-box) this project.
2. Rename your Fork to something like "2015-08-10-my-pet-store".
3. Clone your Fork as you would usually do. This will create a new folder â€“ called **2015-08-10-my-pet-store** for example, with the boilerplate files inside it.
4. `npm install` from the project root. This will install any dependencies that the framework needs,
5. `grunt server` from the project root. This will generate a "build", which contains the actual HTML/CSS/JavaScript files - and it starts a server from which those files are served.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:8889 in any browser or on any device to test the project.

Note: `grunt build` from the project root will put a production version of the project in **/build**.
