Rube Goldberg Machine

-turn the faucet handle-
-to start the water-
to fill up the pot
-while the burner turns on-
to make steam
that collects in the parachute
-the lifts to the bookcase-
and knocks the gear
that hits the books
that make the bowling pin wobble 
that kocks off the magnet
that lifts the bag with jacks and bouncy ball
which lowers the magnet
that attracts the metal pole in the rolly chair
which makes the chair move
that makes the dolly rock
and tip over
making the box tip on it's side
so the open flap allows the mouse cursor to escape
so the mouse cursor finds it's way to the "find out more button"
